The processed imagery can be quite large and we've stored the results on an external drive. 
This large amount of 1024x1024 imagery should be manually sifted through to find the gems that you want to pass to your annotation effort.
I found it fairly easy to view 15-25 images at once in windows explorer and just copy the ones I wanted to annotate to a new folder.
