Folders of images in this location were deemed of value to the computer vision training program by someone that (hopefully) actaully laid eyes on them. Keep in mind that each folder is a date stamp because if you add images to this folder post annotation effort, there are a few things you need to follow up on before they can become part of the annotation process.

TODO: 
Describe what need to happen if we want to add more images for subsequent annotation and training.
