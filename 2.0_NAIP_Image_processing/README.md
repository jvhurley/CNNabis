# NAIP_img_processing.py
The NAIP_img_processing.py script takes a location with all of your 4-band NAIP imagery and another location to write out all of the chopped up NAIP imagery, one folder will be 1024x1024 4-band images and another folder will be 1024x1024 3-band jpegs. Outputs are 1024x1024 pixel images with the number of cuts across and down from the original upper left image. For instance, m_4112630_sw_10_h_20160603_1_4.JPEG comes from the m_4112630_sw image collected on 20160603 and is the chopped image from 1024*1 pixel start and 1024*4 pixel start. This image will cover pixels columns 1024-2048 and rows 4096-5120 from the original image.

We are producing two sets of images because we are interested in training on both the 3- and 4-band imagery. Also, our annotation software is not able to process tif imagery so we have to have jpgs on hand. This has lead to complications and I am interested in modifying ImgLab to work with 4-band imagery (and other types of imagery).
